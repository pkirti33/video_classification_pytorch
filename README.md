# video_classification_pytorch

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook in which I practice with multi-class video classification on the UCF11 video classification dataset. The dataset is hosted on [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khanhvudo72/ucf11updated). I created a mini 3D Convolutional Neural Network based on [Pytorch's 18-layer 3D Resnet Model](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.video.r3d_18.html) and trained it two ways. 

First, I transformed all the videos to custom dimensions (in this case, 100x100)
